          question: "What is your cancellation policy?",
          answer: "Our standard cancellation policy allows free cancellation up to 48 hours before check-in. Cancellations made within 48 hours of arrival may be subject to a one-night charge. Special rates or promotions might have different cancellation terms, which will be clearly stated at the time of booking."
        },
        {
          question: "Do you require a deposit for reservations?",

Please note that modifications may lead to rate changes, especially during peak seasons or if promotional rates are no longer available."

        {
          question: "What happens if I don't show up for my reservation?",

        },
